### Added

#### Terminal Dashboard (TUI)

- Five-panel layout: Containers, Compose Services, Images, Volumes, Networks
- Vi keybindings: `j`/`k` navigation, `g`/`G` jump, `1`-`5` panel switch, `[`/`]` detail tab cycling
- Context menus with per-resource actions (start, stop, restart, remove, exec, up, down, prune)
- Filter/search with `/` across all resource lists
- Confirmation modals for all destructive actions (remove, prune)
- Help overlay (`?`) with full keybinding reference
- Mouse support: click to select, scroll to navigate
- Toast notifications for action feedback
- Expanded layout toggle (`z`) for detail pane focus

#### Real-Time Streaming

- Live log streaming with stdout/stderr coloring (1000-line ring buffer)
- Stats sparklines for CPU and memory usage (60-sample ring buffer)
- Docker event watching with auto-reconnect on connection loss

#### Compose Support

- Automatic project detection from container labels (`com.docker.compose.*`)
- Fallback detection via `docker compose config`
- Merged view showing running containers and planned services
- Per-project actions: up, down, restart, stop

#### Interactive Exec

- Drop into a running container shell via `node-pty`
- Supports bash, sh, and ash

#### CLI Commands

- `sidekick-docker ps` — list containers (non-interactive)
- `sidekick-docker logs <container>` — stream container logs
- `--socket <path>` flag for custom Docker socket
- `--version` flag

#### Docker API Layer (`sidekick-docker-shared`)

- `DockerClient` facade wrapping dockerode with typed methods
- `ComposeDetector` for label-based and file-based project discovery
- `ComposeClient` wrapping `docker compose` CLI commands
- `EventWatcher` with auto-reconnect and typed callbacks
- `StatsCollector` per-container ring buffer with CPU/memory time series
- Full type system: `ContainerInfo`, `ImageInfo`, `VolumeInfo`, `NetworkInfo`, `ComposeProject`, `DockerEvent`, and more
- Utility formatters: `formatBytes`, `formatCpu`, `stateIcon`, `stateColor`, `truncate`

#### VS Code Extension

- Webview-based Docker dashboard with the same panel layout as the TUI
- Typed message protocol for extension-to-webview communication
- Command palette integration: `Sidekick Docker: Open Dashboard`

#### Build System

- tsc for shared library (CommonJS + declarations)
- esbuild for CLI (single ESM binary) and VS Code (dual CJS + IIFE output)
- `bump-version.sh` script for synchronized version updates across all 3 packages
